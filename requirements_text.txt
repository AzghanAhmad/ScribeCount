Q: Why I Use Geniuslink Between Meta Ads and Amazon 

If you're running Facebook/Instagram ads straight to Amazon, there’s a gap in the funnel most people miss:

You lose your pixel audience layer.

Even with Amazon Attribution, Meta doesn’t get much usable 
signal beyond the outbound click — which makes retargeting and optimization way harder.

My flow looks like this:
Meta Ad → Geniuslink → Amazon Attribution → Product Page

That Geniuslink layer does a few things:
Retargeting audiences
Pixel fires on the bridge page, so you can build “clickers who didn’t convert” audiences and run cheaper follow-ups.
Cleaner traffic routing
Instead of sending paid traffic directly into Amazon links, you get a neutral step in between — which can reduce policy friction.
Automatic localization + deep linking
International visitors hit their local storefront. Mobile users route cleanly. Less leakage.
One link, clearer visibility
Geniuslink + Attribution gives you a more complete view of off-Amazon traffic performance.
Bottom line: Attribution measures conversions, but it doesn’t give you the retargeting layer Meta needs. Geniuslink closes the loop.
Smart plumbing makes smart funnels.



 The primary complaint authors have about linking is that it doesnt follow the click all the way to the sale. Since SC will have their email data, sales data, and website traffic data, I'm hoping our linking feature will provide a more complete ROI picture for them.

The UI for this is will need to be as friendly as possible and with minimal friction.
